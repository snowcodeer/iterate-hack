functorial_com_v3 - Improved by AI Supervisor
==================================================

Based on: functorial_com_v2

CHANGES MADE:
- [ACTION SPACE] Changed to hold-based control: action 0 = no hold, action 1 = hold space (matches game mechanic)
- [GAME OVER] Fixed premature termination: reset identical_frame_count during grace period, increased threshold to 60 frames, raised diff threshold to 5.0
- [OBSERVATION] Reduced to 200x125 grayscale for 64x faster processing (from 1.2M to 25K values)
- [REWARDS] Time-based survival rewards that increase with difficulty (0.01 + time/5000), normalized to [-1, +1] range
- [STATE EXTRACTION] Added JavaScript-based game state extraction for reliable score/gameOver detection
- [DEBUG] Added logging every 50 steps to monitor frame differences, scores, and termination triggers
