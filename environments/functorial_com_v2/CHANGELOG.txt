StarDodgeEnv v2 - Improved by AI Supervisor
==========================================

Based on: functorial_com/stardodgeenv.py

CHANGES MADE:
- [GAME_OVER] Added 30-step grace period at start to prevent false positives during loading
- [GAME_OVER] Increased identical frame threshold from 8 to 30 (~1 second) for more reliable detection
- [GAME_OVER] Removed unreliable red pixel color detection that caused false positives
- [GAME_OVER] Added text/DOM-based game over detection (checks for 'game over', 'try again', etc.)
- [REWARD] Added base survival reward (+0.01 per step) to encourage staying alive
- [REWARD] Added score increase reward (+0.5 per point) for successful dodges
- [REWARD] Added milestone bonus (+0.1 every 100 steps) for intermediate goals
- [REWARD] Death penalty (-1.0) creates clear distinction between success and failure
- [FIX] Improved frame comparison using mean absolute difference instead of hash

ISSUES FIXED:
- Episodes were ending prematurely (avg < 30 steps) due to aggressive game over detection
- Reward function was flat (+0.02 per step regardless of action) - no learning signal
- Red pixel detection was triggering on game UI elements
